BeMyEyes Server
====
###This is the server side of Be My Eyes  
Whenever the iOs app makes a request it calls this API.

##Getting started  
You can either use vagrant to run the site - this is the prefered way  
Or you can run the server locally.  

##Configuration
Copy `config.yml` to the `config` folder    
Use the `config.temp.yml` as a template  

##Use vagrant  
Install VirtualBox  
Install Vagrant  
run `vagrant up` in the root directory  

The setup will take some time, since it sets up the entire server.  

When the server is installed log in `vagrant ssh`

Set up a user with the username and password configured in config.yml  
start mongo: `mongo bemyeyes`

    db.addUser( { user: "bemyeyes",  
                  pwd: "myPassword",  
                  roles: [ "readWrite", "dbAdmin" ]
              } )  

Please note to provison the server we have created a script, which can also be used as a template for a server:  
https://github.com/bemyeyes/railsready/blob/master/railsready.sh  
  
##Start the server locally    
    ruby -S rackup -w config.ru

##Authentication
All interactions with the server demands HTTP Basic AUTH - the username password can be found in the config file under the "authentication" section.

##Run tests
  
There is two parts to testing, in the root of the project:  
1. `rspec` will simply run unit tests and tests against the db.  
2. `rspec rest-spec` will run tests against the rest api.  

At the moment the tests are hardcoded to test against `localhost:9001` which is the website exposed by the vagrant server.
